            Action-packed RPG will include dialogue in ten languages as well as subtitles in several more. By using artificial 
            intelligence to lip sync conversation in several languages, CD Projekt Red hopes to create a deeper degree of immersion
             for gamers.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            Mateusz Popawski, the game's lead character technical director, stated in a presentation that CDPR aimed for greater lip 
            sync quality than it is in the Witcher 3. It intended to do so in ten other languages: English, German, Spanish, French,
             Italian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Mandarin, and Japanese.
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The goal was to accomplish all of this for each and every character in the open world. Due to the overall game's massive scale, 
            CDPR had to complete everything with no facial motion capture. To do this, the company used Jali Research's lip syncing and facial
             movement technology to determine how the characters' faces move procedurally.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            A few of the characters in Cyberpunk 2077 speak a different language, shifting in them at times within the same statement. 
            Transcript tagging was employed to adjust for this. When a character's emotion altered within a line of conversation, the 
            labels also helped to adapt their facial expressions. In addition, audio analysis was used by the system to mimic the feelings 
            of a vocal performance in the animations.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            In The Witcher 3, CDPR employed algorithms to help them animate the cutscenes, and it's an advancement of that method. Many
             videogames use motion capture to lip sync dialogue in only one language, which might disrupt realism for players who change
              languages.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            While the shuffled animations in Cyberpunk 2077 may not have been as detailed or descriptive as those in other AAA games, they may
             improve the experience for many gamers who choose to engage in many languages. 
        </div>
        <div class="content reveal">
            Cyberpunk 2077 is among the most exciting games of the year, and it is aiming to be one of the year's biggest titles. This, 
            however, means that Cyberpunk 2077 will include thousands of lines of conversation, dozens of distinct spoken characters, and a
             diverse range of personalities and speech styles. Furthermore, CD Projekt RED reportedly set out with the goal of outperforming 
             The Witcher 3 in terms of lip-sync quality, as well as supporting at least ten languages with native localization. Because 
             traditional face motion capture was ineffective, they sought an alternative patch. JALI is an AI programme that can analyse and 
             animate lip-sync and facial animations programmatically.
        </div>
        <div class="content reveal">
            JALI is a "animator-centric viseme model for expressive lip synchronisation," which means that it deconstructs face animation
             into basic components such as speech, speech style, eyes, brows, emotion, and head and neck movements. It can manage lip-sync
              as well as full emotional expression, including movement of various regions of the face, resulting in performances that seem 
              authentic and powerful without the need for animation. It looks fantastic and will be utilised by every single voiced character 
              in the universe.
        </div>
        <div class="content reveal">
            Even better, because JALI can analyse and interpret numerous languages and dictations, Cyberpunk 2077 will feature native language 
            localization for ten languages, including French, Spanish, Japanese, German, and others, simply by exploiting JALI's innovative power. 
            The video above is a little long, but it has a lot of interesting information on the technology being utilised here, as well as
            examples to demonstrate it. If JALI is consistent throughout the game, Cyberpunk 2077's lip-sync should be really impressive and 
            blend into the background.

            The month-long countdown to Cyberpunk 2077 has begun, with the game recently going gold ahead of its November 19, 2020 release date.
