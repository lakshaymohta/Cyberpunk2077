            CD Projekt Red developed and released Cyberpunk 2077, an action role-playing computer game. Night City, 
            an open world set in the Cyberpunk milieu, serves as the setting for the storey. Players adopt the first-person
            perspective of V, a configurable mercenary with hacking and mechanical talents as well as melee and ranged combat options.

        <div class="para2 fade_scroll intro">
            A team of roughly 500 individuals worked on the game utilising the REDengine 4, which is more than the number of 
            employees that worked on the studio's previous game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015). CD Projekt established a new 
            division in Wrocaw, Poland, and collaborated on the project alongside Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research. 
            Mike Pondsmith, the founder of cyberpunk, served as a consultant, and Keanu Reeves stars in the film. Marcin Przybyowicz 
            headed the original score, which included contributions from a number of licenced artists.
