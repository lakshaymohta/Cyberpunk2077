            Cyberpunk 2077 is a first-person action role-playing game in which you play as V, a mercenary with changeable voice, 
            face, hairstyles, physical type and alterations, background, and wardrobe. Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical,
            and Cool stat categories are influenced by the character classes that players take on, which include NetRunner (hacking),
            Techie (machinery), and Solo (combat). To upgrade and purchase cyberware implants, V must consult a "ripperdoc"; illicit
            marketplaces offer military-grade capability. A coloured tier system indicates the scarcity of any specific piece of 
            equipment. V has the ability to take cover, aim, sprint, jump, double jump, and slide. Close-combat weapons can deal
            with melee attacks. Ranged weapons are classified into three varieties, all of which can be customised and modified:
            Power (standard), Tech (which can pierce walls and adversaries), and Smart (with homing bullets). Ranged weapons can 
            ricochet bullets in the direction of the target, slowing them down in bullet time. Physical, thermal, EMP, and chemical 
            damage can all be inflicted and resisted. The usage of a weapon improves accuracy and reloading speed, which is reflected
            in character animations. Weapons are repaired and upgraded by gunsmiths. With non-lethal choices for weaponry and cyberware,
            the game may be completed without harming anyone.

            The size of Cyberpunk 2077 is around 70 Gb, and gamers must have that much free space on their machine. It is also stated that 
            a gamer must devote approximately 40-50 hours of their time to fully complete the game. This period can also be extended if the 
            players want to finish all six endings in the game. Because of the high graphics and large amount of space required, the game 
            will almost probably require a strong PC to function smoothly. The minimum and recommended system requirements for Cyberpunk 2077
             are as follows to assist viewers.
